    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>You might think this recipe is redundant, but being able to perfectly hard-boil eggs is no minor feat. Espcially if you can't seem to peel them easily.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>egg(s) (as many as you want)</li>
        <li>water (in a pan)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the water first! Boiling the egg(s) in cold water will make the membrane stick to the shell.</li>
        <li>After a rolling boil, bring the water to a simmer. Add the egg(s).</li>
        <li>Close the lid and wait for 8 minutes (6 if soft-boiled is what you're after).</li>
        <li>Immediately move the egg(s) to an ice bath or simply a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking process.</li>
        <li>Peel the egg(s), first by cracking the top on a flat surface, then remove the rest of the shell.</li>
        <li>Voila! Enjoy your egg(s).</li>
    </ol>
